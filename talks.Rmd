<!-- "Discovering dynamic computations in the brain from large-scale neural recordings" -->

<!-- Neural responses and behavior are influenced by internal brain states, such as arousal, vigilance, or task context. Ongoing variations of these internal states affect global patterns of neural activity, giving rise to apparent variability of neural responses to sensory stimuli, from trial-to-trial and across time within single trials. Demultiplexing these endogenously generated and externally driven signals proved difficult with traditional techniques based on trial-averaged responses of single neurons, which dismiss neural variability as noise. In this talk, I will describe my recent work leveraging multi-electrode neural activity recordings and computational models to uncover how internal brain states interact with perception and goal-directed behavior. I will show that ensemble neural activity within single columns of the primate visual cortex spontaneously fluctuates between phases of vigorous (On) and faint (Off) spiking. These endogenous On-Off dynamics, which reflect global changes in arousal, are also modulated at a local scale during spatial attention and predict behavioral performance. I will also demonstrate that these On-Off dynamics provide a single unifying mechanism that explains general features of correlated variability classically observed in cortical responses (e.g., changes in neural correlations during attention). I will conclude by sketching out a roadmap for developing a general theory that will allow us to discover dynamic computations from large-scale neural recordings and to link these computations to behavior. -->

#### Dr. Nadav Ahituv, Wednesday, January 11, 2017, 4 PM, 108 Wartik Lab

"Functional Characterization of Gene Regulatory Elements"

#### Dr. Claire Cheetham, January 12, 2017, 4 PM, 008 Mueller

Dr. Cheetham’s research aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which neurons form and maintain precise connections. She approaches the question using the mouse olfactory bulb system, which is experimentally accessible in vivo and undergoes adult neurogenesis. She uses a combination of optogenetics, electrophysiology and behavior to study how new neurons are integrated into functional circuits. She has made important contributions to our understanding of synapse formation and maturation in both cortex and the olfactory bulb. She earned her PhD with Dr. Gerald Finnerty at University College London where she showed that a critical period for map reorganization in the visual cortex corresponded to presynaptic maturation. She then moved to NIH to work with Dr. Leo Belluscio where she developed her current model system. She is currently an independently-funded Research Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon.

#### Dr. Rachel Roberts-Galbraith, January 17, 2017, 4 PM, 008 Mueller

Dr. Roberts-Galbraith uses planarians as a model organism to study brain regeneration. She received her Ph.D. from Vanderbilt where she trained as a cell biologist under Dr. Kathleen Gould and received an NSF graduate fellowship. She developed her planarian model system in the laboratory of Dr. Philip Newmark at the University of Illinois where she received a prestigious Jane Coffin Childs fellowship. Using transcriptomic and genomic approaches, she has identified dozens of genes involved various aspects of nervous system regeneration. She plans to follow up this work to characterize fundamental mechanisms through which neurons and glia are made and organized following injury.

"Epigenetics and the Long-term Effects of Nicotine on Learning and Hippocampus"

#### Dr. Patrick Drew (Penn State), January 20, 2017, 11:15 AM, 127 Noll Laboratory

"Imaging Cerebral Hemodynamics during Exercise” 

The brain is an energetically demanding organ, and increases in blood flow (usually) accompany increases in neural activity. However, how exercise impacts blood flow to the brain is poorly understood.  I will discuss recent work from my lab using optical imaging in awake behaving mice to elucidate how voluntary locomotion drives hemodynamic signals in the cortex.  We find that locomotion-induced hemodynamic changes in the cortex are mostly driven by neural changes, not systemic cardiovascular changes, and that there are markedly different locomotion-related dynamics of vessels in the brain versus those in the dura.

#### Dr. Matthew Dalva (Jefferson College of Biomedical Sciences), January 25, 2017, 4 PM , 108 Wartik

"Visualizing the Dynamics in Synaptic Formation and Function"

#### Dr. Gyorgy Lur, January 26, 2017, 4 PM, 008 Mueller

Dr. Lur uses optical and electrophysiological approaches to study signaling in cortical networks. His long-term goal is to determine how multiple sensory signals are integrated modulated by behavior in the cortex. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool where he studied calcium signaling in polarized secretory cells. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Higley at Yale University where he has pioneered new methods to combine cellular electrophysiology with 2-Photon imaging to make important new insights into synaptic integration in individual cortical neurons.
