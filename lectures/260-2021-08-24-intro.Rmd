## Keys for success

- Study the figures.
- Study regularly -- don't cram.
- Come to class.
- Participate!

## Why is biology essential for the science of behavior?

- What is science?
    - What distinguishes sciences?
    - What is neuroscience?
- Why is neuroscience harder than physics?

## What is [science](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science)?

## What is science?

- Body of facts or truths
- Process of acquiring knowledge
    - Systematic study
    - Observation, experiment, description
    - Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws
    - *Strives* for objectivity
 
## Gilmore on science vs. other ways of thinking

---

- Science is a *way of thinking* and a *set of behaviors*
- Science *describes*, tries to *predict*
- Science alone not well-suited to *prescribing* (recommending) or *proscribing* (prohibiting)
    - little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc.
    - (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims...)

---

- Science rests on **evidence and logic** 
    - <span class="blue">NOT on authorities</span> (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status)
    - However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others.
    
---

- Science respects tradition
    - but questions and tests it repeatedly...
- Science should be reproducible
    - others can get the same answer

---

- Science
    + has led to huge advances in human health and prosperity over the last several centuries
    + will be essential for maintaining and extending those advances in the future

<!-- ## [Mertonian norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms) -->

<!-- - **universalism**: scientific validity independent of sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants -->
<!-- - **“communalism”**: common ownership of scientific goods (intellectual property) -->
<!-- - **disinterestedness**: scientific institutions benefit a common scientific enterprise, not specific individuals -->
<!-- - **organized skepticism**: claims should be exposed to critical scrutiny before being accepted -->

<!-- <div class="notes"> -->
<!-- Modern science aspires to embody these norms. -->
<!-- </div> -->

## Similarities between sciences

- What are the different kinds of X?
    - **Form**, e.g., anatomy
- How does X work?
    - **Function**, e.g., physiology
- Where did X come from?
    - **Origins**, e.g., development/evolution
    
## Examples

- "Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape."
- "Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China."
- "Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus."

## Differences among sciences

- Phenomena of interest (studying what)
- Methods or tools (studying it how)
- Levels of analysis
    - Spatial scale (nanometers $10^{-9}m$ to light-years $10^{15}m$)
    - Temporal scale (milliseconds $10^{-3}s$ to millenia $10^3s$)
    
## What is neuroscience?

- The study of the nervous system
    - And the behavior it makes possible
- Questions neuroscience asks...
    - What are the parts of the nervous system?
    - How do the parts work?  What do they do?
    - Where did they come from?

## A bit about systems

- Neuroscience studies the nervous system...
- But what are systems?

## Related ideas

- Wikipedia on [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
- Wikipedia on [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)
- Wikipedia on [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)
    - *Science concerned with the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing and processing information so as to use it for control.*
    
## Systems you know...

- Think of a system you know something about
- What makes it a system?

## Non-biological examples

- Solar system
- Climate system
- Economic system
- Internet

## Systems have

- Boundaries
- Components
- Interactions
- Forces/influences
- Inputs, outputs, processes

## Systems...

- "Behave" or change state across time
- May return to starting state
- Appear to be regulated, controlled, influenced by feedback loops

## May be thought of as [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science)

## Why is studying systems so hard?

- Single parts -> multiple functions
- Single functions -> multiple parts
- Change structure/function over time (learning, development)
- Naturally occurring systems not "designed" like human-engineered ones
- What information is being processed? What is being controlled?

## Next time...

- History of neuroscience
- Methods of neuroscience
